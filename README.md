# Hangman Game

Welcome to the "Hangman" game repository! This classic word-guessing game is now available in a Python implementation. Test your vocabulary, problem-solving, and deduction skills as you try to uncover the hidden word letter by letter.

## How to Play

1. The game will select a random word, and you must guess it by suggesting letters one at a time.
2. You have a limited number of attempts (typically represented by the "hangman" figure).
3. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman will be drawn. Try to guess the word before the hangman is fully drawn.
4. After each guess, you'll receive feedback on whether the letter is in the word and where it's located.

## Features

- A user-friendly interface for an enjoyable gaming experience.
- A wide range of words to guess, making each game unique.
- The ability to customize the difficulty level.
- An engaging and educational way to expand your vocabulary.
- A fun and challenging project for Python enthusiasts.
